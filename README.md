## About Me

Hi, I’m Noemi Vargas — Data Analyst, problem solver, and lifelong learner.

I bring more than 20 years of experience at AT&T spanning Loss Prevention, Engineering, and Network Data Analysis, where I consistently used data to improve performance, streamline operations, and support decision-making. My work has included leading teams, building automated reporting systems, developing dashboards, and analyzing operational and network trends using SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

More recently, I’ve applied these same analytical skills within an e-commerce business, using sales analysis, experimentation, and performance tracking to guide strategy and growth. Today, I’m focused on advancing as a Data Analyst, combining technical analysis, business context, and clear communication to help organizations turn data into meaningful direction.
