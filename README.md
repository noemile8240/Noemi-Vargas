Hi, I’m Noemi Vargas — Data Analyst | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner

I’m a data-driven professional with a long history of turning complex information into clear, actionable insights. After 20+ years at AT&T across Loss Prevention, Engineering, and Network Data Analysis, I’ve built a career around one constant theme: using data to solve problems and improve performance.

My Journey

I started in Loss Prevention, leading a 17-person team and creating an automated performance evaluation system adopted across multiple departments. That success led me into Engineering, where I transitioned into analytical roles focused on building dashboards, automating reports, and designing tools to streamline operations.

As a Network Data Engineer, I worked with SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to analyze network health, identify trends, and deliver insights that improved system reliability. I later applied these same analytical skills to my own e-commerce venture, using A/B testing and sales trend analysis to guide business decisions.

Today, I’m focused on growing my career as a Data Analyst, combining technical expertise, project management experience, and a love for solving problems to help organizations turn data into meaningful direction.
